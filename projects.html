### [ReSignMe](https://github.com/LonnyGomes/ReSignMe)

ReSignMe is an OS X app that simplifies the process of re-signing an iOS app down to a few clicks of the mouse. The user is able to drag any ad-hoc signed ipa into the app and re-sign it with one click. The goal of this app is to be as easy as possible to use.


### [hexcurse](https://github.com/LonnyGomes/hexcurse)

Hexcurse is a curses-base hex editing utility that can open, edit, and save files, editing both the hexadecimal and decimal values.

It was written by [Lonny Gomes](https://twitter.com/lonnygomes) and [James Stephenson](https://plus.google.com/u/0/103174459258175070784/about) but we haven't maintained it for some time. We recently saw an old tarball of the code floating around the net and thought it would be good to start maintaining the codebase again.

It currently supports searching, hex and decimal address output, jumping to specified locations in the file, "undo" capabilities, "bolded" modifications, EBCDIC mode, and quick keyboard shortcuts to commands.

### [vjs-video](https://github.com/LonnyGomes/vjs-video)

With `vjs-video` you can easily incorporate video into your Angular projects using the roubust HTML video player `video.js`. The directive also adds additional features such as data-binded media sources and a responsive video container (for video.js 4.x). `vjs-video` works with 4.x and 5.x versions of `video.js` just in case you're not ready to upgrade.

### [Country GeoJSON Data](https://github.com/LonnyGomes/CountryGeoJSONCollection)

This repository contains a collection of GeoJSON and topoJSON files of all country boundaries derieved from the Natural Earth 1:10m cultural vectors dataset. Python and nodejs is used to generate the resulting files.
