## About

I write code and used to write poetry (tried to at least). I love language and the universal ways that humans can connect with the nexus of art and technology.

Here you'll find some of my photogrpahy, music and opensource software projects. My contact information can be found [here](contact.html) if you need to get a hold of me.
