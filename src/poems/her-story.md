<pre>The soulful moans
  of the alto saxaphone
  tell a story.
She tells her story
  backed by syncopated bass lines
    and a funky drummer that keeps in time
  with the heartbeat
    of the city streets.
Her lamentation strikes a chord
  with all who've had to struggle.
Her melody rings true for all
  all of those still in the hustle.
Her story is my story,
  it is your story,
    it's our history.</pre>
