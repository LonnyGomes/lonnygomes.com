<pre>I saw a site that Abraham in all his glory never witnessed ...

A colony of clouds amidst

  the sea of the sub heavens.

Clouds of varying shapes and sizes,

  all unique,

yet seemingly content to coexists with each other.

The ruler of this colony sat a top a thrown of condensation

  allowing us to pass

    with hopes that we could learn from them

      before we destroy our kingdom and theirs.</pre>
