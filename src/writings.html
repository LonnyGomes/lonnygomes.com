<h1>Writings</h1>

I am not a writer but that has not stopped me from trying. Here are various
writings that I have done over the years.

<table class="writings-table">
    <tr>
        <th>Section</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </th>
    <tr>
        <td><a class="writings-table-link" href="{{ '/blog/' | url}}">Blog</a></td>
        <td><em>Coming soon!</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a class="writings-table-link" href="{{ '/haikus/' | url }}">Haiku</a></td>
        <td>Over the years, I have written ist of the my haiku over the years. They are
            pretty random and contextless and are largely for self-posterity sake.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a class="writings-table-link" href="{{ '/quotes/' | url }}">Quotes</a></td>
        <td>These are a compilation of my disparate ideas to quote back to my future self at the opportune time.</td>
    </tr>
