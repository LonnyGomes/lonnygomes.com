<h1>Writings</h1>

I am not a writer but that has not stopped me from trying. Here are various
writings that I have done over the years.

<!-- <h2><a href="{{ '/haiku' | url }}">Haiku</a></h2>
<p>
    Over the years, I have written ist of the my haiku over the years. They are
    pretty random and contextless
</p>

<h2><a href="{{ '/quotes' | url }}">Quotes</a></h2>
