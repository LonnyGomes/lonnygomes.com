With the intention of learning hugo and to reboot my personal site (one of my 2018 goals), I'm creating this inaugural post. I plan to use this space to document and share my various software, photography and DIY projects.

I still am getting the hang of using hugo and am not certain on which base theme I want to settle with thus far but so far like the workflow and the concepts behind hugo more so then my limited experience with jekyll.
